Got irritated trying to solve this one particular level and decided to write up a quick solve for this
Tested on some levels like 98 and 99 and few others.

Enter the input from left to right in order from bottom to top color for each bottle

This is a simple backtracking algorithm and Prints solution in reverse order

Need to figure out a way to solve levels with ?. For now, can reveal their colors and feed it as an input

Purpose was to brush up on coding skills and not find shortcuts for the game
